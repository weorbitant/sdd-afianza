  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "clientId": "uuid",

]
```

---

## POST /v1/client-teams/:clientId/department/:department

**Auth**: `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT_EDIT` + `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENTS_{DEPARTMENT}_EDIT`

**Path params**: `clientId`, `department`

**Body**:
```json
{
  "startDate": "2026-06-01"   // must be first-of-month
}
```

**Response 201**: Created team object (same shape as GET item)

**Errors**:
- `409 ACTIVE_TEAM_EXISTS` — an active team already exists for this client+department
- `400 DATE_NOT_MONTH_BOUNDARY` — startDate is not the first of a month

---

## PUT /v1/client-teams/:clientId/:teamId/close

Close an active team. Sets `endDate` to the last day of the specified month. Also sets `dateTo` on all active members of that team.

**Auth**: `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT_EDIT` + `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENTS_{DEPARTMENT}_EDIT`

**Body**:
```json
{
  "endDate": "2026-06-30"    // must be last-of-month
}
```

**Response 200**: Updated team object with `endDate` set and `isActive: false`

**Errors**:
- `400 DATE_NOT_MONTH_BOUNDARY` — endDate is not the last day of a month
- `400 DATE_BEFORE_START` — endDate is before the team's startDate
- `404` — team not found
- `409 TEAM_ALREADY_CLOSED` — team is already closed

---

## GET /v1/client-teams/:clientId/:teamId/members

Get all members (active + historical) of a team.

**Auth**: `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT_VIEW`

**Response 200**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "employee": { "id": "uuid", "name": "Ana", "surname": "García" },
    "role": "asesor",
    "percentage": 60,
    "dateFrom": "2026-01-01",
    "dateTo": null,
    "isActive": true
  }
]
```

---

## POST /v1/client-teams/:clientId/:teamId/members

Add a member to an active team.

**Auth**: `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT_EDIT` + `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENTS_{DEPARTMENT}_EDIT`

**Body**:
```json
{
  "employeeId": "uuid",
  "role": "asesor",
  "percentage": 60,
  "dateFrom": "2026-06-01"
}
```

**Response 201**: Created assignment object

**Errors**:
- `409 TEAM_CLOSED` — team is already closed
- `409 ROLE_ALREADY_FILLED` — RESPONSABLE or COORDINADOR slot is already taken
- `409 ROLE_CONFLICT` — employee already has a different role in this team
- `400 DATE_NOT_MONTH_BOUNDARY`
- `400 PERCENTAGE_OUT_OF_RANGE` — percentage not in 1–100

> Note: Adding a member does NOT validate the 100% sum. The sum is only validated by `POST /commit` (see below). This allows building a team incrementally as a draft.

---

## PATCH /v1/client-teams/:clientId/:teamId/members/:assignmentId

Update the percentage of a member (closes current assignment and opens a new one with updated % from `effectiveFrom`).

**Auth**: `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT_EDIT` + `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENTS_{DEPARTMENT}_EDIT`

**Body**:
```json
{
  "percentage": 40,
  "effectiveFrom": "2026-07-01"   // must be first-of-month; defaults to next month
}
```

**Response 200**: New assignment object (old assignment receives `dateTo = effectiveFrom - 1 day`)

**Errors**:
- `400 PERCENTAGE_VALIDATION_FAILED` — after update, asesor or técnico group no longer sums to 100%
- `400 DATE_NOT_MONTH_BOUNDARY`
- `404` — assignment not found
- `409 TEAM_CLOSED`

---

## DELETE /v1/client-teams/:clientId/:teamId/members/:assignmentId

Remove a member from the team (sets `dateTo` = `effectiveTo`).

> Operates on a draft team. Does **not** validate the 100% sum nor the ≥1-asesor rule — those are checked only on `POST /commit` (see [ADR-0007](../decisions/0007-draft-commit-team-model.md)). A removeMember call can legitimately leave the team in an invalid state during construction; the commit endpoint will reject it later.

**Auth**: `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT_EDIT` + `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENTS_{DEPARTMENT}_EDIT`

**Query params**:
- `effectiveTo` (optional) — last-of-month date; defaults to current month's last day

**Response 204**

**Errors**:
- `400 DATE_NOT_MONTH_BOUNDARY` — `effectiveTo` is not the last day of the month
- `404` — assignment not found
- `409 TEAM_CLOSED`

---

## POST /v1/client-teams/:clientId/:teamId/validate

Validate a team's current state (100% sums, minimum members). Use before saving.

**Auth**: `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT_VIEW`

**Response 200**:
```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "violations": [
    { "code": "PERCENTAGE_VALIDATION_FAILED", "sum": 90, "required": 100, "membersIncluded": ["ASESOR", "TECNICO"] }
  ]
}
```

---

## POST /v1/client-teams/:clientId/:teamId/commit

Confirm a draft team. Validates the 100% sum per role and the minimum-asesor rule, marks the team as committed, and publishes one `backoffice-api.v1.client-assignment.updated` event per active member (carrying the new `percentage`). This is the **only endpoint** that runs the full validation and publishes events; `POST /members`, `PATCH /members/:id` and `DELETE /members/:id` operate on the draft.

**Auth**: `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT_EDIT` + `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENTS_{DEPARTMENT}_EDIT`

**Body**: empty

**Response 200**:
```json
{
  "teamId": "uuid",
  "committedAt": "2026-06-01T10:00:00Z",
  "membersPublished": 3
}
```

**Errors**:
- `400 PERCENTAGE_VALIDATION_FAILED` — sum of team members (ASESOR + TECNICO; RESPONSABLE and COORDINADOR excluded) ≠ 100%. Body includes `{ "sum": 90, "required": 100 }`.
- `400 MIN_ASESOR_REQUIRED` — team has zero active asesores.
- `404` — team not found
- `409 TEAM_CLOSED` — team is already closed (re-commit not allowed)

> Side effect: each active `ClientAssignment` in the team is published to RabbitMQ on routing key `backoffice-api.v1.client-assignment.updated`, including `percentage`. Consumers (Plataforma del Dato, etc.) receive the canonical post-commit state.

---

## POST /v1/client-teams/:clientId/:teamId/reassign-tasks

Manually reassign PENDING tasks from one employee to another within a team.

**Auth**: `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT_EDIT` + `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENTS_{DEPARTMENT}_EDIT`

**Body**:
```json
{
  "fromEmployeeId": "uuid",
  "toEmployeeId": "uuid",
  "taskIds": ["uuid", "uuid"]   // optional; null = all PENDING tasks for fromEmployee in this client+dept
}
```

**Response 202** (async — triggers RabbitMQ event):
```json
{ "status": "accepted", "message": "Task reassignment queued" }
```

---

## GET /v1/client-teams/:clientId/department/:department/active-summary

Quick summary of the active team for a client+department. Used by the client ficha header.

**Auth**: `CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT_VIEW`

**Response 200**:
```json
{
  "teamId": "uuid",
  "startDate": "2026-01-01",
  "memberCount": 4,
  "percentageSummary": {
    "ASESOR": { "sum": 100, "valid": true },
    "TECNICO": { "sum": 100, "valid": true }
  }
}
```

**Response 204**: No active team exists for this client+department.
